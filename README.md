## Contributing & Feedback
I'm an interaction designer by trade, and have decided to use Glyphr Studio as a giant crash course in JavaScript and HTML5.  Since this is my first major HTML5/JS app, there are many opportunities for growth & improvement - for both code, and collaborative development styles.
If youâ€™d like to contribute a feature or bug fix, please make sure to search the issue tracker first, your issue may have already been discussed or fixed in master.  After researching, please feel free to fork and send a pull request.

## Running the App
Modern browsers usually won't allow you to run Javascript from your local machine without a web server. To run the app, either serve the 'app' folder of this repo up with your web server or

* Install node.js
* Run 'node server.js' from within the root project directory to start the app
