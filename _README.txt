	Welcome to GLYPHR
	
	Public facing stuff can be found at glyphrstudio.com
	
	The point of this project is to create a web-based font editor.
	The one main problem?  I'm not a developer, just an interaction
	designer.  Essentially, I'm using this project to teach me the
	finer points of JavaScript / HTML5 application creation.  
	
	I'm afraid the source code will be horrendous to look at if you
	are anybody closely resembling a developer.  I've done very 
	little research into development methods, with the idea that
	I will learn by doing.
	
	Having said all that, eventually I hope to have a free, web
	based font editor geared toward font design hobbyists.
	
	Any feedback, questions, or ideas can be directed to:
